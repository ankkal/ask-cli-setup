## AWS CLI Setup - Installation

The primary distribution method for the AWS CLI on Linux, Windows, and macOS isÂ `pip`, a package manager for Python that provides an easy way to install, upgrade, and remove Python packages and their dependencies.



Please select one of the following:

[Windows Installation](aws-cli-setup-install-windows.md)  |  [MacOS Installation](aws-cli-setup-install-mac.md)   |  [Linux Installation](aws-cli-setup-install-linux.md) 



**Note**: If you already have the CLI installed, continue to 
## [Setup an AWS CLI Profile](aws-cli-setup-profile.md), or, if you don't have an AWS account, follow the [guide to create an AWS account](new-aws-account.md) first.
