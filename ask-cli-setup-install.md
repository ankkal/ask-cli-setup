## ASK CLI Setup - Installation



The ASK CLI requires an Amazon Developer Portal account. Make sure to [create an account](new-dev-portal-account.md) first.

Node.js 4.5 or greater and Node Package Manager (npm), which installs with Node.js. To check the version of node.js, open a command prompt and type the following:

```
$ node --version
```

To install or update your version of Node.js, refer to theÂ [Node.js downloads page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).



#### To install ASK CLI

Use `npm` to install ASK CLI. If you already have ASK CLI installed and want to update to the latest version, the same command can be used.

```
$ npm install -g ask-cli
```

If you are using Linux, the installation may require `sudo`:

```
$ sudo npm install -g ask-cli
```
