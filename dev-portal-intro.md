## Alexa Skill Building - Prerequisites

To recap, this guide will walk you through the process of setting up all the necessary resources to develop and publish Alexa Skills. 

By now you should have completed the following:

✓ **An AWS Account** (if not, follow the [guide to Create a new AWS Account](new-aws-account.md))

✓ **AWS CLI Installed** (if not, follow the [guide to install AWS CLI](aws-cli-setup-install.md))

✓ **An IAM User and a Corresponding AWS CLI Profile** (if not, follow the [guide to setup an AWS CLI Profile](aws-cli-setup-profile.md))



What is left is

- you need an Amazon Developer Portal account
- you need to the ASK CLI tool
- you need to configure the ASK CLI with a Profile



#### Do you have an Amazon Developer Portal Account?

If you already have Amazon Developer Portal account that you would like to use, go straight to the ASK CLI setup, otherwise follow the guide and create a new Amazon Developer Portal account now. 

**Note** Amazon Developer Portal is not the same as Amazon AWS and the accounts are different. Similarly, the AWS CLI and the ASK CLI are different tools!
